# PROJECT-B.U.D.D.Y

Build your own voice ai. Building an AI voice assistant with PyTorch.

## Looking for contributors!
Looking for contributors to help build out the assistant. There is still alot of work to do. This would be a good oppurtunity to learn Machine Learning and how to Engineer an entire ML system from the ground up.
