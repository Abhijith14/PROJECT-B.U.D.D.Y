# PROJECT-B.U.D.D.Y

Build your own voice ai. Building an AI voice assistant with PyTorch.

## Looking for contributors!
Looking for contributors to help build out the assistant. There is still alot of work to do. This would be a good oppurtunity to learn Machine Learning and how to Engineer an entire ML system from the ground up.

TODO:
- [ ] wake word model and engine
- [ ] pre-trained wake word model use for fine tuning on your own wakeword
- [ ] speech recognition model, pretrained model, and engine
- [ ] natural langauge understanding model, pretrained model, and engine
- [ ] speech synthesis model, pretrained model, and engine
- [ ] skills framework
- [ ] Core A.I. Voice Assistant logic to integrate wake word, speech recongition, natural language understanding, speech sysnthesis, and the skills framework.
- [ ] Adding Skills : 
- [ ] Game Analysis ( Single Player and Multi Player) mode
- [ ] Gesture Control
- [ ] Face Detection
- [ ] Emotion Analysis
